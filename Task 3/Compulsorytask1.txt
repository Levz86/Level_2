1) it is not clear how the user selects the destination. Also if i wanted to select more than one destination. would the system allow this? 
What if the credit card is invalid. does the sytem ask for valid credit card information and transaction canceled
it states that a ticket will be issued, does that mean it will print a ticket or have something online? how will it show proof of ticket being issued?

2) the system should be clear for users to select their destination.
it should give clear and helpful error messages when the credit card is invalid or ID number is inncorrect
there should be options to add more than one destination
it should print a physical ticket with all the trip and train information on the ticket
the trip information should also be sent via sms to the users cellphone

it is assumed the system should accept all major credit cards
